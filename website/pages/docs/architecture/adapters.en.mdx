# Converters

**Inlang supports file formats other than Fluent through converters.** Converters "convert" file formats other than Fluent to and from
Fluent. The latter entails that not every functionality that Fluent/inlang supports is supported
by every converter (due to syntax features) and vice-versa.

<Callout type="warning">
  Only functions that fluent supports can be supported by converters. For
  example, Fluent only supports one nested layer of attributes i.e. an `id` with
  two layers named `login.button.close` won't work. See the [Fluent syntax
  specification](https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/).
