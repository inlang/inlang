# @inlang/website

The website is based on the Nextra 2.0 alpha. Thus, fragile. For example, can't be run with `npm` but requires `pnpm`.

## How to run locally

1. install `pnpm`
2. `pnpm i`
3. `pnpm dev`

**Can someone build Docusaurus/Nextra for SvelteKit please with [MDsveX](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX)?**
