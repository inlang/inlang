// Workaround to have types working in test code.
//
// See https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx/issues/871#issuecomment-695822562
//
// **TLDR**
// VSCode takes the nearest tsconfig, the regular tsconfig does not include
// test code, thus tons of linting errors. Workaround -> have a seperate
// tscnfig that includes test code but is not used for compilation.
